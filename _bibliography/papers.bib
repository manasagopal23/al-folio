  title={Small Business Recovery from the Financial Crisis: The Role of Collateral},
  author={Gopal, Manasa},
  abstract={I study the persisting effects of the financial crisis on small businesses in the U.S.
To carry out my analysis, I link loan-level data on the universe of non-real estate,
secured lending in the U.S. to the U.S. Census of establishments. First, I use text
analysis to create a measure of collateral specificity based on detailed descriptions
of loan collateral. I show that, following the financial crisis and Dodd-Frank
regulations, as banks move out of lending to small businesses and are substituted
by nonbanks, firms with highly specific collateral are cut out of the lending market.
They face larger and longer lending shocks and this translates to lower employment
levels ten years after the crisis. I show that my effect holds across firms within an
industry-region.},
